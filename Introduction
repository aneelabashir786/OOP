## What is OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code using objects which contain data (attributes) and behavior (methods).
It helps in writing reusable, scalable, and maintainable code.


## 4 pillors of OOP

1. Encapsulation

Definition:
Encapsulation means binding data and methods together and restricting direct access to data.
Encapsulation improves data security and code maintainability.

How:
Using access specifiers like private, protected, and public.

2. Abstraction

Definition:
Abstraction means hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.
Abstraction focuses on what an object does, not how it does it.

How:
Using abstract classes or interfaces.

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated (object cannot be created) and is used only as a base class. ( can be inherited) 

It may contain:

* abstract (pure virtual) functions → no implementation
* normal functions → with implementation
virtual void draw() = 0;

3. Inheritance

Definition:
Inheritance allows a class to reuse properties and behavior of another class.
Inheritance promotes code reusability and hierarchical relationships.

Polymorphism

Definition:
Polymorphism allows the same function name to behave differently.
Polymorphism makes the system flexible and extensible.

Types:

Compile-time (function overloading)

Run-time (method overriding)
